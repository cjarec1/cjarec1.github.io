                <p>Hi! My name is Caroline Jarecke and in May 2019 I graduated with a degree in Computer Science with
                    a Digital Media minor. I really enjoy incorporating art and coding together. According to the brain dominance
                    theory, there are two sides of the brain: the left side - the logical side - and the right side - the
                    creative side. While most people identify themselves as either 'left-brained' or 'right-brained,' I consider
                    myself both-brained - I love the analytical, problem-solving aspects of computer science and the creativity
                    and imagination of art!</p>
                <p>I mostly have experience in front-end development, using HTML and CSS to make webpages look aesthetically
                    pleasing. I also have a little bit of experience using JavaScript and jQuery, and recently I've started
                    to learn React (I'm looking forward to learning more as well)! I've used Java and C# for various classes.</p>
                <p>I can remember being 13 or 14 and using HTML to make my profile on a website look nice; that
                    was my first experience with HTML, and I've been hooked since. I love it so much that I'd love to do
                    it full-time. I'm very passionate about creating what I consider to be artwork with code. When I do something,
                    I always go all-out in order to do the best that I can. I go into every day with a positive attitude,
                    and I can't wait to put my creativity and passion into my work.</p>
                <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my website!</p>
